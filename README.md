The DevOps team from SparkDev at FIU

The DevOps team is creating a simple react app that will have its own CI/CD Pipeline through a GitLab server on a Raspberry Pi.

Steps within the process:

1. Creating the react app.
2. Setting up the GitLab CE server on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Setting up the yml file and runner for GitLab.
4. Creating the tests for the pipeline to test the various modules of the React App.
5. Use a traffic simulator to test the app.
6. Set up a Grafana Dashboard to monitor traffic from the traffic simulator.
